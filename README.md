TalkRemote
==========
Talk Remote is a remote control app used by the audience of a lecture to provide feedback to the lecturer in real time.

Audience members join a room and press video-player-like "remote control" buttons that then update the lecturer's remote display.

Play = "This pace is perfect. Let's keep going."
Pause = "Stay right here; I need to know more about this topic."
Fast-Forward = "I know all about this stuff. Let's move on."
Rewind = "Slow down please! This lecture is moving too fast for me right now."
Eject = "Stop! I'm completely lost."

The lecturer receives a count of participating audience members' votes and can fine-tune the lecture accordingly.
